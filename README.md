# CompoundEscrow
first solidity smart contract
This is a simple escrow contract between a seller, buyer and logistics partner. Buyer and seller both agree on a deal, then the buyer funds the contract.
Upon funding, the seller can ship his product. The logistics party then decides when to release the funds to the seller (upon successful transportation).
Instead of the funds sitting idle inside the contract, the idea behind it was to use a DeFi Protocol (Compound) in order to earn some interest on it.
